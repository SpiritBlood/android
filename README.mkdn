Building
--------

After the sync is finished, please read the [instructions from the Android site](http://s.android.com/source/building.html) on how to build.

    . build/envsetup.sh && brunch hammerhead


You can also build (and see how long it took) for specific devices like this:

    . build/envsetup.sh && time brunch hammerhead

Remember to `make clean` every now and then!
